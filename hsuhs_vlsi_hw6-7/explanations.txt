Part1.3
(1) FSM Coverage is not 100%. All states have been visited; however, there are "2" uncovered FSM transitions, which is
SUBT -> DONE, and SWAP -> DONE. In the normal situation, these two transitions will never appear. 
Because FSM states that the next state of SUBT or SWAP will never be the DONE state.
Instead, the next state of SUBT is "TEST" and the next state of SWAP is "SUBT". 
Therefore, it's a correct behavior that the report does not cover these two transitions.

However, only one situation can satisfy these two transitions. 
That is, the reset_n signal is deasserted when the present state is SUBT or SWAP.
In this situation, the next state will be back to DONE. 
Unfortunately, it's not possible to represent in this homework because we are only allowed to modify the input_date but not testbench!!

All in all, the reason why is not able to reach 100% FSM coverage is due to the "unexpected behavior" rather than the design error.

(2) Condition Coverage is not found in the design files, which is also the normal condition.
Because the design files do not contain any condition, e.g., "==".
All the conditions are existed in testbench, but they are not required to be covered because of they are not design files.
Therefore, I use the "exclude" command in the .do file.

Part5
Reason of low coverage for the cross-point in the first covergroup is the following cross-point is not our expected behavior.
bin <subt,done>                                              
bin <swap,done>                                          
bin <done,subt>                                                
bin <subt,subt>                                              
bin <done,swap>                                               
bin <subt,swap>                                               
bin <swap,swap>                                                
bin <swap,test>                                            
bin <test,test>                                       
All in all, the above bins do not cover; therefore, it causes the low coverage for the cross-point in the first covergroup.

Part6
For the modification of the first covergroup, I list these bins to be illegal bins:
bin <done,subt>                                                
bin <subt,subt>                                              
bin <done,swap>                                               
bin <subt,swap>                                               
bin <swap,swap>                                                
bin <swap,test>                                            
bin <test,test>
Because these transitions are all not supposed to happen. If they happens, it must be an illegal situation as we can clearly see from the FSM.

As for bin <subt,done>, bin <swap,done>, I set them as ignore bins. 
Because in the specific situation, such as if reset_n deassert, these transition are valid.
The details have been mentioned in Part1.3(2).

For the modification of the second covergroup, 
because the result never covers 5000 in the previous simulation, I add a_in & b_in =  5000 as one of the inputs in the post_input_data file.
Through this, the result now will cover 5000. 
Finally, all bins in the second covergroup will be covered, and the final functional coverage report is now 100%.
