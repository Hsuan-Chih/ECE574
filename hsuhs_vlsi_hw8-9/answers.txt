Give some thought to the sensitivity list of the always block in which the assertion is evaluated: 
should it be posedge clk, or *? Why?

Ans: it should be @(*). This is becasue clk in this situation is not the only sensitivity list,
but the "condition", reset_n, is also the important sensitivity list too.
To be specifically, because reset_n is asynchronous reset, that's why we can not have the clk to be the only sensitivity list.
And the asynchronous reset is the key hint to modify the guilty code.
